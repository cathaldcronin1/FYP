FYP - Data Mining & Visulisation
===

For further reading I've also wrote a techincal report with the University of Limerick on my FYP which includes much more detail about it!

**Technical Report:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271503999_Visualisation_of_GitHubs_Public_Data

*Overview*
===
This visualisation represents the current state (at any given moment) of the relationship between
programming languages used in the open-source development community (i.e. GitHub). The visualisation
can provide an insight into what programming languages are most popular and most widely used amongst
the open-source community. Thus it can potentially help young software developers get an orientation
into what programming languages to become proficient at.

Data Mining &amp; Visualisation 

* Application is deplyed on heroku.

* Availible here: http://language-connectivity.herokuapp.com/

* Data Gathered through GitHub's RESTful API: https://developer.github.com/v3/


**Output Showing Language Connectivity.**
===

The thicker an edge connection between nodes is, the more popular or more used this language is.
Likewise a small edge thickness indicates this language pair isn't as widely used.
